Decentralized Image Sharing with IPFS & Blockchain

This project is a decentralized image-sharing system that leverages IPFS for storage and Ethereum smart contracts for ownership tracking. It allows users to upload image hashes to IPFS, store them on the blockchain, and retrieve ownership details.

Features:
âœ… Upload images to IPFS and store the hash on the blockchain
âœ… Track image ownership using Ethereum smart contracts
âœ… Retrieve all stored images along with their owners
âœ… Built with Solidity, Hardhat, and Ethers.js

First of all after downloading the git,run this command in cmd on the same folder as path

npm install 
--run this on cmd

ðŸš€ Future improvements: Frontend integration, MetaMask authentication, and deployment on a public testnet!
